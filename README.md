# ChIP_seq_Motif_Prediction

# This project aims to help understand the workflow of the systemPipeChIPseq pipeline for analyzing ChIP-seq data. 

# ChIP-seq data from Kaufman et al. (2010) that analyzed APETALA1 binding sites are used to:
#  1. Assess quality and filter/trim data if necessary.
#  2. Align reads to a reference genome.
#  3. Compute coverage across the genome.
#  4. Call peaks and generate a consensus peak.
#  5. Annotate peaks.
#  6. Analyze differential binding.
#  7. Conduct an enrichment analysis.
#  8. Predict motif and identify putative binding sites.
